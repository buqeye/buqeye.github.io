In this contribution we briefly recapitulate the progress made in constructing fast and accurate emulators
for few-body scattering and reaction observables based on eigenvector continuation. Emulators have
been game changers and we envision them to play a key role in future workflows in nuclear physics and
beyond. They have the potential to push the frontier of precision nuclear physics even further by enabling
full Bayesian analyses of nuclear structure, scattering, and reaction observables, as well as by facilitating
constraints for chiral interactions from (lattice) quantum chromodynamics (QCD). The future will show
what other exciting applications are within reach.

This is a collection of perspective pieces contributed by the participants of the Institute of Nuclear Theory's Program on Nuclear Physics for Precision Nuclear Physics which was held virtually from April 19 to May 7, 2021. The collection represents the reflections of a vibrant and engaged community of researchers on the status of theoretical research in low-energy nuclear physics, the challenges ahead, and new ideas and strategies to make progress in nuclear structure and reaction physics, effective field theory, lattice QCD, quantum information, and quantum computing. The contributed pieces solely reflect the perspectives of the respective authors and do not represent the viewpoints of the Institute for Nuclear theory or the organizers of the program.
