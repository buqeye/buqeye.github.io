The L&#252;scher method in Lattice QCD was recently  generalized to enable low-energy nuclear scattering results to be extracted from the  discrete energy levels of the target-projectile clusters confined by harmonic potential traps.  Here we report encouraging results for neutron-$\alpha$ and neutron-$^{24}\mathrm{O}$ elastic scattering from analyzing the trapped levels computed using two different *ab initio* nuclear structure methods. The $n$-$\alpha$ results have also been checked against a direct *ab initio* reaction calculation. The $n$-$^{24}\mathrm{O}$ results demonstrate the approach's applicability for a large range of systems provided their spectra in traps can be computed by *ab initio* methods.  A key ingredient  is a rigorous understanding of the errors in the calculated energy levels  caused by inevitable Hilbert-space truncations in the *ab initio* methods.
