Eigenvector continuation (EC) has been shown to accurately and efficiently reproduce ground states for targeted sets of Hamiltonian parameters. It uses as variational basis vectors the corresponding ground-state eigensolutions from selected other sets of parameters. Here we extend the EC approach to scattering using the Kohn variational principle. We first test it using a model for S-wave nucleon-nucleon scattering and then demonstrate that it also works to give accurate predictions for non-local potentials, charged-particle scattering, complex optical potentials, and higher partial waves. These proofs-of-principle validate EC as an effective emulator for applying Bayesian inference to parameter estimation constrained by scattering observables.
